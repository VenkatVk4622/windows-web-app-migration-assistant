This CloudFormation template creates an Amazon EC2 instance running Windows, along with an associated security group. Here's a breakdown of the components:

Resources

1. EC2 Instance (Ec2Instance)

AMI: Uses the AMI with ID ami-0453ec754f44f9a4a. (This should be a Windows AMI.)

Instance Type: t3.medium.

Tags: Sets the instance name to WWAMA Lab.

Security Groups: Attaches the security group MySecurityGroup.

KeyPair: Uses a key pair specified by the parameter KeyPair.

UserData:
Downloads the Windows Web App Migration Assistant (WWAMA) as a ZIP file from GitHub to C:\wwama.zip.
The script runs under PowerShell.

2. Security Group (MySecurityGroup)

Name: SimpleWinGroup.
Description: Allows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) traffic.
Ingress Rule: Opens TCP port 3389 for all IP addresses (0.0.0.0/0).

Parameters

KeyPair:
Prompts the user to specify a KeyPair name (used for SSH/RDP access).

Outputs
ServerDns:
Outputs the Public DNS Name of the created EC2 instance.


Resulting Resources
A Windows EC2 instance suitable for hosting the WWAMA tool.

A security group that allows unrestricted RDP access to the instance (not recommended for production due to the open ingress rule).

The Public DNS Name of the instance as an output for easy access.
Notes

The security group's open CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0 allows anyone on the internet to attempt RDP access, which is a security risk. It is recommended to restrict this to a specific IP or range.
Ensure the AMI ID corresponds to the desired Windows version in your AWS region.
